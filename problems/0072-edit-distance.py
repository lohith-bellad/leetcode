Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to
convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
    * Insert a character
    * Delete a character
    * Replace a character


Example 1:
    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
        horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
        rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
        rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
    Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
        intention -> inention (remove 't')
        inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
        enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
        exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
        exection -> execution (insert 'u')


Constraints:
    * 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
    * word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
