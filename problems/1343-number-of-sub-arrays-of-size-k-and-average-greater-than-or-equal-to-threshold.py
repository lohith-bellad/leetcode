1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold
Medium

Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the
number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.


Example 1:
    Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5], [5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages
        4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have
        averages less than 4 (the threshold).

Example 2:
    Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater
        than 5. Note that averages are not integers.


Constraints:
    * 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
    * 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
    * 1 <= k <= arr.length
    * 0 <= threshold <= 10^4
